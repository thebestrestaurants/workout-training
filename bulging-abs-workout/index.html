<p><strong>Bulging Abs Workout</strong>, This exercise can be done statically or in pulses. However you can speed the process along and make your abs more impressive by building up the muscles so that they bulge out slightly more. Compound free-weight exercises such as squats and deadlifts are excellent for developing your abs but to bring the muscles up to their full potential you should add two 15-minute ab sessions each week focusing on core-stability exercises.</p>
